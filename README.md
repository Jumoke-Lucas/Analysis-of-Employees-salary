# Analysis-of-Employees-salary
An analysis carried out on employees and their salaries at a company using SQL and visualized using Tableau.

### ABOUT THE DATASET
I dumped the database containing the datasets in MySql and uploaded the files on Github.
**The database contains 5 tables** 
1.t_employees
2.t_dept_manager
3.t_departments
4.t_salaries
5.t_dept_emp

These tables contain numerous columns as seen [here](https://github.com/Jumoke-Lucas/Analysis-of-Employees-salary/blob/main/employees_mod_db.pdf)
